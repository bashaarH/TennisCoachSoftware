# Tennis Coach Software
This Java Project was a school project that was designed to be used by a Tennis Coach to record scores to record the scores from their students' practice mathces. This software records score on a point by point basis, not a set basis. I.e, the match mechanics are the following, every point counts, at the end of the rotation (signalled by the coach), the one with the higher points win. 

Coaches can record these scores and look at analytics like head to head record, win percentage per day and wins where the players are serving in the match versus not-serving. Students can be imported and reomved as needed and data can be exported and imported to allow for use of several devices. 

Feel free to make ammendments to this to improve it or to customize for your own use!
